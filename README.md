# neural_network
Here I want to share with you my self-made neural network only using numpy. Feel free to use it. I will work on this in the upcoming days/weeks to improve it. So actually the code is a bit messy, sorry for that. 

I have added a visualization of the neural net using pygame. My goal is to create a visualization of the learning process and the evolution of the decision boundary (first only on a simple moons dataset).

After I've done that, I will improve this further, maybe add some useful functions and visualizations.
